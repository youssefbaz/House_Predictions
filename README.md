House Price Prediction
This project is focused on predicting house prices using a dataset of housing features from the USA. We use linear regression as the primary model to predict prices based on various factors like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.

Introduction
In this notebook, we analyze a dataset related to housing prices in the USA. We explore the data, engineer new features, and build a linear regression model to predict house prices. Finally, we evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²).

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to houses in the USA, including:

price: The price of the house
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
sqft_living: Square footage of the living space
sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot
floors: Number of floors
waterfront: Whether the house is on the waterfront (binary)
view: Quality of the view from the house
condition: Overall condition of the house
sqft_above: Square footage of the house apart from the basement
sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement
yr_built: Year the house was built
yr_renovated: Year the house was renovated (if applicable)
street, city, statezip, country: Address details
Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. The project dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

Usage
To run the analysis and model training:

Open the Jupyter Notebook (House_Predictions.ipynb).
Run all cells to see the data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
You can adjust the model parameters and explore different features to improve the model.
Features
Data exploration and visualization
Feature engineering for improved predictions
Linear regression model for price prediction
Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R-squared metrics
Visualization of actual vs. predicted prices and residuals
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language
Pandas: For data manipulation
NumPy: For numerical computations
Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualization
Results
The linear regression model achieved the following performance metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Approximately $85,677
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Approximately $23,038,297,730
R-squared (R²): Approximately 0.78
These results indicate that the model explains around 78% of the variance in house prices.
